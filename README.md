# Interview-Coding-Puzzles

I recently finished a Programming course here in Barcelona, and I am looking for an internship or a Junior position to help me gain practical experience and enter the industry. 

I have heaed about the technical portions of interviews, and decided to challenge myself on that to get my skills up to snuff.

I found a list of websites which seem useful (thanks to [Anushka's Post here](https://github.com/anushka23g/Complete-Placement-Preparation?tab=readme-ov-file#readme)) and will work down the lists; 
- First, I will be coding in a way that makes sense to me
- Then, I will revisit them and look for more efficient solutions.

Starting with the exercises proposed in [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&sortBy=submissions) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/).

---
In ***First Attempts***, I place my first goes at the problems encountered, tackling them without any time constraints on myself or the pressure from interviews. The idea is to see how well I can do on my own steam.

If I have any issues or come across new topics that I find more complex, I may create new folders where I can work on and improve those skills.

I am here to learn and improve my skills, so as always - feedback is more than welcome :)
